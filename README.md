# qmcpack_objects
Minimal and module python representations of various objects in QMCPACK:
1. H5Conf: config.h5
2. H5Stat: stat.h5
3. InputXml: input.xml
4. ScaldarDat: scalar.dat

The purpose of this repository is to simplify on-the-fly analysis. The python objects provide a simple interface to manipulate the objects related to QMCPACK. One can use a Jupyter notebook to interactively view and change the various objects without having to manually edit each file.
